/**
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

Example 1:

Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
Example 2:

Input: [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum
             jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
*/

//java version 1 : just iterate and update the maximal index that can reach (greedy)
/**
"reach" means how far you can go from the starting point. The question changes to 
"Can you reach the ending point from the starting point?" Here, starting point is index=0, 
ending point is index=array.length-1. 
That's the reason why we do "i+A[i]". Our view is always starting from index=0.
